This project presents the design and implementation of a database for a hospital management system. The database aims to streamline hospital operations by managing patients, doctors, departments, appointments, prescriptions, medical records, billing, and room assignments. The methods employed include conceptual modelling, logical and physical design, and the use of SQL Server Management Studio for implementation. Results include a robust, normalized database schema and sample data population for testing. Conclusions highlight the database's ability to improve hospital efficiency and data accessibility.
